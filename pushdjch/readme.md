## About pushdjch

pushdjch is a chat application written with django and pusher for a tutorial at scotch.io. To use this demo, please do the following:

- clone this repository.
- run pip install -r requirement.txt to install pusher and django.
- create at least two super users using python manage.py create superuser command.
- finally, run the application using python manage.py runserver.
- **Note: by default, in the pusherchat\views.py and templates\chat.html, the app key and security key present there are mine which i used for testing. You should change it if you have your own pusher**.
